1 - In this tutorial we are going to send through ErgoUtils Airdrop, 10 TutorialsCoin to 6 addresses simultaneously.

2 - The first thing we have to do is enter the ErgoUtils.org site and click on the Airdrop option.

3 - We will create a list of addresses to which we are going to send our tokens. We can give this list a name to identify it in the future.

4 - I am going to create 6 addresses within the same wallet for the example.

5 - Once we have completed the list we click save and select that we will send a custom token, in this case the one we have created in previous tutorials: TutorialsCoin.

6 - To see the ID of the token we go to ErgoTokens.org and locate the ID through its search engine.

7 - We add it to the Airdrop form and enter the exact amount we are going to distribute among the addresses in our list.

8 - We must bear in mind that the TutorialsCoin token is created without decimals, for this reason the amount of tokens to be distributed must be able to be divided exactly between the addresses.

9 - 60 TutorialsCoin divided by 6 addresses can be divided without remainder.

10 - Once we click on Initiate, the data to make the shipment will appear on the screen. As always, we will click on the address to take the clipboard to our wallet and make the shipment.

11 - We send the 60 tokens to the indicated address and automatically distribute them to the different addresses.

12 - In the Yoroi wallet the 60 tokens will appear together, since the 6 addresses belong to the same wallet, but we can see in the Ergo explorer that the sending was carried out correctly.
