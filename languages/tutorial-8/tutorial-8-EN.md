Title - Create a raffle and participate in ErgoRaffle.
Description - In this tutorial we will create a raffle in Erfo Raffle as an example and participate in an existing raffle. Ergo Raffle: https://beta.ergoraffle.com/ If you want to see more tutorials about Ergo visit: https://ergotutorials.com/

1 - In this tutorial we are going to use Ergo Raffle to create a sample raffle and then we will participate in another that already exists.

2 - We must take into account that Ergo Raffle allows a percentage of the total jackpot of the raffle to be destined to a third party or entity. 
What does this mean? That once we define our raffle, there will be a winner (chosen at random from among the participants) and apart the third party or entity, which will take the chosen percentage without having to participate.

3 - We entered the Ergo Raffle website.

4 - Once in Ergo Raffle we will configure our wallet from Set Wallet. The configuration is as simple as pasting our address and click on Set.

5 - Next we will go to the Create Raffle option where we will see a form to configure our raffle. 
We introduce name and description.

6 - We must bear in mind that the Charity field is the one destined for the third party or entity that is going to win a percentage of the raffle without having to do anything else.

7 - The Donation Goal field refers to the goal of the raffle, that is, the minimum amount that must be reached for the raffle to take effect.

8 - We indicate the price we want the participation or ticket to have.

9 - In the DeadLine field we will define the duration of our raffle, this amount refers to mined blocks, we can see in the field on the right
the real-time equivalency. We choose 10 blocks that are approximately 20 minutes.

10 - When choosing the percentages we must take into account that 5% will be for service expenses, we have the remaining 95% to distribute between the winner of the raffle and the charity account that refers to the third party or entity.

11 - To finish creating the raffle we will have to read and accept the Ergo Raffle terms of use.

12 - On the screen we will see a message with the exact amount and the address to which we have to send the fee for publication.
Remember that to copy the address and the amount you can click on them. We will use Yoroi to make the payment.

13 - In a few minutes the transaction will be effective and we will be able to see the correctly created raffle in the list of active raffles.

14 - We can see that the raffle has been created successfully.

15 - We browse the active raffles to choose one in which we will participate now.

16 - We selected the Christmas Lottery in Ergo raffle in which the winner of the raffle gets the maximum possible.
As this raffle is configured, only 1% of the 200 Ergos of the goal is destined for Charity, the rest is for the winner of the raffle.

17 - We select the number of tickets that we are going to buy, in our case we buy 1 for 0.5 Ergos plus fees.

18 - We accept the terms of use and click Donate.

19 - Again it will show us a message on the screen indicating the exact amount and the address to which we have to make the payment.

20 - Once the transaction is complete we return to Ergo Raffle to see our participation.

21 - Raffles that fail to reach their goal will not be held and participants will be reimbursed.
