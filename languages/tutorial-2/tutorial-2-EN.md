1 - In this tutorial we will install the Yoroi extension and create a wallet.

2 - The first thing we will do is to install the Yoroi extension in our browser. 

3 - Once it has been installed we can set the extension in our bookmarks to have it always at hand. 

4 - Open the extension and select the language.

5 - We read and if we agree we accept the terms of use. 

6 - We have decided to accept Cardano's paid URLS, if you don't know what it is you can skip this option. 

7 - Yoroi will offer us three options: connect to hardware wallet, create wallet and restore wallet. Click on create wallet. 

8 - Select Ergo.

9 - Here we will give a name to our wallet and a spending password that will be the one we will use in every transaction we make.

10 - Next, Yoroi will show us a set of 15 words that will be the recovery phrase for your wallet. It is imperative that you write them down on a piece of paper and keep them in a safe place.

11 - To validate the recovery phrase we must place the 15 words in the correct order.

12 - We have already created our wallet.

13 - As additional information you should know that as long as you have this 15 word seed phrase in your possession you will be able to restore your wallet on any computer.

14 - Together with the spending password is the only thing that no one should know about your wallet, keep the phrase secret and well guarded. It is not recommended under any circumstances to write it down by taking a screenshot of our device.
