3 - To create our token we will select New Token and fill in the form that defines the characteristics that our token will have. Number of units that we are going to issue, I am going to create 1 million TutorialsCoin and without decimals. We add the name and description and press issue.

4 - A notice will appear on the screen that includes an amount to pay and an address where you have to pay for the creation of our token to take effect. We will have to do something as simple as go to our wallet and make the payment with the exact amount to that address. Remember that you can copy the address and the exact amount to the clipboard by clicking on them.
