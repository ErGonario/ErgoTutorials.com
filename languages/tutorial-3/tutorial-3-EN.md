1 - In this tutorial we are going to see how to download ErgoMixer from Github to make a mix with the Kushti token and send it to another wallet.

2 - In Github we will download the latest version of ErgoMixer, I am going to download the .dmg file for Mac, remember that you must download the .exe if you work with Windows.
For the download we will go to the following URL.

3 - This URL can be found in the Github link on our website or the video description.

4 - Install the program normally on your computer.
Once installed, when you open the application with double click or right-click it may indicate an error saying that the developer is not verified, we will have to open our file by pressing the Control + Click key and pressing Open. This way we will not have problems.

5 - We open our ErgoMixer application and go to our browser and type http://localhost:9000

6 - Once the Ergo Mixer interface opens, click on the Active Mixes option to create a new mix in Start New Mix.

7 - Then we select the token and the amount we want to mix and click next.

8 - We select the rings to determine how we want to mix our tokens and click next.

9 - Now we will enter the address where we want to receive our tokens already mixed, for this example I will manually enter 2 different addresses to receive them. 
I will create them on the fly in Yoroi.

10 - There is the possibility to choose later the address where we will receive our mix and even select them through the node or a .json file.

11 - Once the addresses have been entered, we click next and a screen appears to configure the mixing level we want. We can observe the different rates that each of these mixing levels has.

12 - ErgoMixer cannot guarantee the exact number of rounds to mix.

13 - We must bear in mind that our tokens will be more anonymous as more rounds go through.

14 - Once configured, click on Start Mixing and you will be taken to a screen with the information to make the pre-mixing transactions.

15 - In this particular case we will have to send a quantity of ERG and a quantity of Kushti to the indicated address to start the mixing.

16 - Once we have sent the deposits to the indicated address our status changes from Pending deposit to Pre-Mixing, the icon changes and we go to Creating mix boxes.

17 - For this example we are not going to wait for the mixing to complete because it can take a long time, we will select Withdraw now manually to the address we set at the beginning.

18 - The transaction is generated and can be viewed in the Ergo Explorer.

19 - Once our transaction has confirmations we will be able to see our tokens in the wallet.

20 - We will do the same for the second.

21 - Our mixes would already be finished, we can see in our direction that the two mixed Kushti shipments have arrived.

22 - We can see that no active mix appears anymore, it has gone to the mix history where we can consult it whenever we need.
